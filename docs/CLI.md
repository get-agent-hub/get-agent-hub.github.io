# Command reference

Start with `ahub quick` for terminal setup or `ahub ui` for the local interface. `ahub` and `ahub --help` show six everyday command groups. Use `ahub --advanced --help` for all groups, or `ahub --advanced COMMAND --help` for technical options. Existing commands, JSON contracts and generated runtime calls remain supported.

In a terminal, quick and project connection show their plan and ask before applying. Explicit `--dry-run`, `--json` and noninteractive calls preview without writing. Script applies require the exact reviewed revision and timestamp where applicable.

## Everyday commands

Integration commands are normally invoked by configured clients or callbacks, not typed during ordinary setup. `undo` reverses a recorded setup workflow, `restore` reverses one stage, and `reset` returns to the first baseline. Repointed bindings and later changes can block recovery; use each current preview.
